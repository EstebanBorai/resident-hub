# Stack

This application is completely build with TypeScript using Fastify and NextJS
to power up a server with Server Side Rendering capabilities for ReactJS.

Docker is also used to host a MongoDB instance.

For ReactJS components styles we are using TailwindCSS, composing utilities
with the `@apply` and `@screen` features.

# Usage

## Development

> You will need NodeJS v14.15.4 or greather installed to run this project.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

This command will download all required dependencies for your project.

2. Run the development server

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Sources will be built and the project will be served on http://localhost:3000/.

## Production

For production use you must build both client and server source into plain
JavaScript.

A configuration for this come OOTB with the `build:production` npm script
will build both client and server sources separately and prepare a directory
with the files

1. Execute `yarn run build:production` to generate `./dist` directory
2. Execute `node ./dist/main.js`

The following output should be printed in your terminal

```log
$ node ./dist/main.js

> event - compiled successfully
```

## Docker

Run this project with Docker using the `Dockerfile` included.
First you must build the image using `docker build` command:

```bash
PORT=3000 docker build -t thruway .
```

Then run the container by using the `./bin/docker_run_default` script.

## Environment Variables

Check on `.env.sample` for an example of environment variable settings and
create a new `.env` file for your environment variable during development.
